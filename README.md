This project involves the development of a dynamic food 
website aimed at promoting and expanding a culinary business. 
The website serves as a digital platform for showcasing the 
business's offerings, including menu items, special promotions, 
and catering services. Through a user-friendly interface, 
customers can browse the menu, place orders online, and make 
reservations for dining-in or private events. Leveraging 
responsive design principles, the website ensures seamless 
accessibility across various devices, enhancing user experience 
and engagement. Additionally, the integration of interactive 
features such as customer reviews, social media sharing, and 
newsletter subscriptions facilitates customer interaction and 
loyalty. By leveraging digital marketing strategies such as 
search engine optimization (SEO) and targeted advertising, the 
website aims to attract and retain customers while driving 
business growth and revenue. The project emphasizes the 
importance of leveraging digital technologies to enhance the 
visibility, accessibility, and profitability of culinary ventures in 
the competitive food industry landscape.  
PROPOSED METHOD  
• HTML  
The role of HTML in web development is to provide the backbone and 
structure of a web page. It defines the layout and organization of 
content on a web page by using a ranked structure of elements. 
HTML tags allow developers to specify the type of content being 
displayed and how it should be presented.  
• CSS  
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a computer language used to structure 
and lay out web pages. It's used to add visual effects and layout to 
HTML elements. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide 
Web, along with HTML and JavaScript. These three tools are often 
called the building blocks of the web. It's a style sheet language used 
to specify how documents are presented to users. CSS can be used 
to change the appearance and layout of a webpage, and to define 
how a website's view changes in different screens.  
• PHP  
PHP stands for "pre HTML" programming language, as it was 
designed to extend HTML and not replace it. It’s one of the most 
popular server- side scripting languages used by CMS developers, 
forums, eCommerce websites, blog sites and nearly every other 
website using a dynamic backend system. But what is PHP used for? 
When a user has an interaction with a web page with PHP, the 
computer hosting the page will read the code segment and execute 
it, and then send back a response to the user. The user never sees 
the code but interacts with the results of the code. You can use PHP 
to create customized content, create logins and sign-ups, collect data 
and make calculations. We can also use PHP to create simple or 
complex animations and graphics. PHP can be used to create any kind 
of dynamic website, including ecommerce sites.  
• SQL  
SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a powerful and standardized 
programming language designed for managing and manipulating 
relational databases. It serves as a communication bridge between 
users and databases, allowing users to interact with and retrieve 
information from databases efficiently.  
Key aspects of SQL include:  
Database Management:  
SQL is primarily used for managing relational database systems. It 
enables the creation, modification, and deletion of databases and 
their components, such as tables, indexes, and views.  
Data Querying:  
SQL provides a set of commands for querying databases to extract 
specific information. The SELECT statement is fundamental, allowing 
users to retrieve data based on specified criteria.  
Data Manipulation:  
SQL supports commands for inserting, updating, and deleting data in 
the database. The INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements are used 
for these operations.  
Data Definition:  
SQL allows the definition and modification of the structure of a 
database using commands like CREATE, ALTER, and DROP. These 
statements are crucial for designing the schema, specifying data 
types, and defining relationships between tables.  
Data Integrity:  
SQL supports mechanisms to maintain data integrity, including 
constraints (e.g., primary key, foreign key) and triggers. These 
features help ensure the accuracy and consistency of data.  
Transaction Control:  
SQL provides commands for managing transactions, allowing users to 
control the execution of multiple SQL statements as a single unit. This 
helps maintain the consistency of the database in the event of 
failures.  
Security:  
SQL includes security features to control access to databases and 
their components. Users can be granted specific permissions, 
restricting their ability to perform certain operations.  
Normalization:  
SQL supports the principles of database normalization to organize 
data efficiently, minimize redundancy, and reduce the likelihood of 
data anomalies.
